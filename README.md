# RESULT---RESTful-API-WebsiteRetriever
This is a simple program written in Java. I also used the Spring framework for easy http requests and the RESTful API http response. The program also gets an integer through a query parameter and uses it as a variable that declares multiple concurrent threads, which are then used to access certain site URLs. From there, the program extracts the desired HTML elements from certain websites via previously specified URLs. It also counts successful and unsuccessful connections established via the RESTful API.
